<!-- 
    A page that presents the full details of a specific event. This page should allow the user to book the event. 
    Assuming that you have multiple events listed on your site, you only need to prototype one example of an item 
    page (just make every item link point to that for now).
        The page should have an image of the event, description of the item, date of the event, and other event 
        specific information that you have designed.
        The page should allow the user to book an event if it is available. A modal allowing a user to enter the 
        quantity may be supported (the design is flexible).
        The page should allow the user to see existing comments posted by other users on the event. It should 
        also support a user to post comments on the event.
